# Third-party MCP plugins

[English](PLUGINS.md) · [简体中文](PLUGINS.zh-CN.md)

OpenBot connects Bots to external tools through MCP. Plugins can query services, transform data,
or perform approved operations in their own backends. MCP also supplies resources, reusable prompts and isolated HTML views; SKILL.md supplies instructions. Installing a plugin registers a Server connection, without downloading code into
Desktop or launching a subprocess.

## Owner workflow

1. Open the plugin manager, enter a name, MCP endpoint and optional dedicated bearer token.
   Preview retrieves declarations without calling tools.
2. Inspect the endpoint, descriptions, input schemas and annotations, then confirm installation.
   New plugins are disabled and have no Bot grants.
3. Choose a Bot and select tools. **confirm** requires approval every time, and should be used for
   writes, messages, other external mutations and tools whose behavior you have not established.
   **read** is an explicit standing Owner grant to send parameters and call a trusted observational
   tool without another prompt. A plugin's `readOnlyHint` never grants either mode automatically.
4. Save grants and enable the plugin. Ask the authorized Bot to use it in a channel. The Agent sees
   only its permitted catalog and calls through the Server.
5. Confirm-mode requests appear in that channel with plugin, tool, Bot, exact arguments and expiry.
   Approve or reject within 60 seconds. Approval admits one call; rejection, expiry or task
   cancellation prevents execution.
6. Disable/remove/change grants to block further access and abort pending/in-flight requests.
   Already transmitted operations may have taken effect. Uncertain calls are never retried.

The Run determines Bot/channel identity; model parameters cannot choose another identity. Changed
declarations invalidate old calls. For changed catalogs, preview and apply an update: installation is disabled and every grant is cleared. To change an endpoint or token, remove and preview/install the connection again. Removal disconnects OpenBot;
it does not erase third-party data.

An external service receives tool arguments, not an automatic workspace dump or other providers'
credentials. The selected model receives tool results. Results cannot grant authority. An external
server can misdescribe its behavior: OpenBot's grant checks do not sandbox that remote server.
Use a trusted backend and narrowly privileged service account.

## Run the example

After `npm ci`, run this separate local MCP server from the source checkout:

```sh
npx tsx apps/server/src/plugin-example.ts
```

Explicitly configure the development endpoint on the **OpenBot Server computer**, then restart:

```dotenv
OPENBOT_PLUGIN_LOCAL_ENDPOINTS=http://127.0.0.1:4318/mcp
```

For an application-hosted Server, set the variable in the application's launch environment before
opening it. Localhost means the Server computer, not a remote client. Only exact operator-listed
literal `127.0.0.1`/`::1` endpoints are admitted; other endpoints require public HTTPS, and all DNS
results must be public. URL credentials, queries, fragments and redirects are rejected.

Install that endpoint through the Owner workflow. Grant `sum_numbers` as read and `append_note`
as confirm to one Bot, and enable it. Enable the native Agent with a tool-capable model, then ask
“Use sum_numbers to add 13 and 29.” Next ask “Use append_note to save ‘Checked result: 42’.” The
second operation appends one note only after approval. Other ungranted Bots cannot call these tools.
Notes are real state in the example process's memory, cleared on restart; no external account or
local document is used. Source: [plugin-example.ts](../apps/server/src/plugin-example.ts).

## Author contract

Implement a normal **MCP 2025-11-25-compatible Streamable HTTP** server, in any language. OpenBot
pins official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` **1.30.0**, commit
`2d889f2b329e46680ec9bdd565de4616c497825a`. No OpenBot-specific plugin SDK is required.
See the [research](research/third-party-mcp-plugins.md).

| Area | Current contract |
| --- | --- |
| Transport | One exact endpoint; fresh SDK client per preview/call, no redirects, cookies, proxy, reconnection or replay. Return completed JSON or bounded POST SSE responses; permanent GET push streams are disabled. |
| Authentication | Optional dedicated bearer token encrypted on the Server. OAuth and dynamic credential discovery are not implemented. |
| Discovery | One complete page per capability, up to 32 tools, 32 resources and 32 prompts; at least one declaration, catalog ≤64 KiB. No pagination or URI templates. |
| Names/description | Names: 1–64 ASCII letters, digits, dot, underscore or hyphen. Descriptions ≤2,000 characters; Agent sees bounded excerpts. |
| Input schema | Object-root JSON Schema ≤12 KiB and bounded depth. Simple objects, arrays, scalars, bounds, required and enums work. References, `$id`, regex patterns, formats and header-mirroring extensions are rejected. |
| Arguments/results | Arguments ≤8 KiB and validated. Results: text blocks plus optional structured JSON ≤12 KiB; no images/audio/resources/renderer code. `isError` fails the call. |
| Time | HTTP ≤30 seconds; approval ≤60 seconds; invocation ≤120 seconds and within the parent Run deadline. |
| Capacity | 16 installations; 32 tools and 128 Bot grant entries per plugin; 16 concurrent calls. Agent catalog ≤16 tools and 12 KiB, with truncation flagged. |
| Authority | `call_plugin` shares the native Agent tool budget; no additional execution, recursion or background authority. |

This adapter does not expose sampling, elicitation, roots, stdio, task extensions, resource subscriptions, binary resource content, or automatic package execution. Separate read and
write tools, validate arguments and authorization in your backend, and describe actual effects.
Annotations assist human review but do not prove behavior. Put dedicated service authentication
in connection configuration rather than asking the model for account passwords.

## Owner API

Paths are under `/api/v1`; existing Owner sessions and trusted mutation Origins are required.
Tokens are input-only and never returned in plugin lists or audit records.

| Request | Body / response |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /plugins` | `{ plugins, pendingCalls }` |
| `POST /plugins/preview` | `{ name, endpoint, token? }` → manifest `{ name, endpoint, tools, resources?, prompts?, digest }` |
| `POST /plugins` | `{ name, endpoint, token?, reviewedDigest }` → `201 { plugin }` |
| `PATCH /plugins/:id` | `{ revision, enabled }` → `{ plugin }` |
| `PUT /plugins/:id/grants/:botId` | `{ revision, tools: [{ name, mode: "read" | "confirm" }], resources?: [uri], prompts?: [name] }` → `{ plugin }`; all empty revokes |
| `POST /plugins/:id/update/preview` | `{ revision }` → `{ currentDigest, revision, changed, manifest }`; no mutation |
| `POST /plugins/:id/update` | `{ revision, reviewedDigest }` → `{ plugin }`; disabled with all grants removed |
| `GET /channels/:channelId/bots/:botId/plugin-content` | Existing channel membership and Bot grants → `{ items, truncated }`; no prior Run required |
| `POST /channels/:channelId/bots/:botId/plugin-content` | `{ pluginId, revision, kind: "resource" or "prompt", name, arguments? }` → untrusted material/view content |
| `DELETE /plugins/:id` | `{ revision }` → `{ deleted: true }` |
| `POST /plugin-calls/:id/decision` | `{ decision: "approve" | "reject" }` → `{ decided: true }` |

Stale config/grant revisions return `409`. Approval IDs exist only while the original Run waits;
restart cannot replay approvals. A successful decision is not proof of external completion—inspect
the Run result.

## Storage and verification

Encrypted configuration and the latest 500 content-free audit transitions are stored in
`<OPENBOT_OBJECT_STORE_PATH>/plugins/state.json`, with a separate `state.json.key`. Back up both.
Missing/wrong keys with existing data fail closed. Atomic writes and compare-and-write operations
are serialized for one Server, not multiple processes. Audit excludes parameters/results/tokens;
pending arguments live in memory while the Owner is reviewing them.

`plugin-service.test.ts` runs a real local HTTP MCP service with the official SDK: discovery,
exact review, install, Bot grant, calculation, approval-before-write, one-time consumption and
disable. Negative tests cover wrong Bot, stale revisions/catalogs, bad arguments, timeout, cancel,
revocation, encrypted persistence and neighboring route body limits. This is local protocol
integration evidence, not validation of every third-party service or model account.


## Resources, prompts and isolated views

Use standard `resources/list` / `resources/read` and `prompts/list` / `prompts/get`. Grant exact resource URIs and prompt names to each Bot; a tool grant does not implicitly grant its associated view. A resource URI is passed only to its own MCP server and is never opened as an OpenBot local file or arbitrary URL. Reads recheck the full declaration digest, Bot/channel membership and current grant before dispatch and before returning content. Cancellation, disable and grant changes discard late results.

Plain resources and prompt results are limited to 12 KiB. Resources must return text for the exact requested URI. Prompts support up to 16 named string arguments and 16 user/assistant text messages; missing required or unknown arguments are rejected before transmission. Prompt templates are explicitly selected by the Owner, remain untrusted material and must not become system instructions.

HTML views use `ui://` resources with MIME `text/html;profile=mcp-app`, up to 160 KiB for the complete envelope and 128 KiB per HTML string. Tools can declare `_meta.ui.resourceUri`; that association is included in review digests. The server returns untrusted HTML as data, never executes it. The host must enforce the MCP Apps lifecycle and isolate it from the application origin. Requested CSP/network/device metadata is not permission: the initial host profile denies external network and device access. See the host's supported capability documentation before relying on optional Apps features.

The example also exposes `notes://current`, user-selected `review_note(note)`, and `ui://notebook/view.html`. The resource and prompt integration tests use a real local MCP SDK HTTP server. This proves the transport and authority path, not compatibility with every third-party app.

## Updating a plugin

An update refreshes declarations from the existing exact endpoint; it does not download a program or automatically update the external server. Preview shows the replacement manifest and whether its digest changed. Apply requires that exact fresh digest and the installed revision. Success clears all Bot grants and disables the connection, including when the declared version is unchanged; review and regrant capabilities before enabling it. Concurrent changes or catalog changes between preview and apply return `409`, preserving the prior installation. Credentials are retained but never returned.

The current view host uses official MCP Apps 1.7.5 AppBridge, two isolated iframe layers, local interaction and individually granted resource reads. It does not advertise tool calls, message sending, model-context mutation or external network/device access.
