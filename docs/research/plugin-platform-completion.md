# Research: MCP resources, prompts, apps and reviewed updates

- Status: Accepted for implementation
- Date: 2026-09-10
- Owner: OpenBot contributors
- Acceptance journey: Owner reviews a plugin's resources and prompts, grants individual capabilities to a Bot, reads them in that Bot's channel scope, and explicitly replaces changed declarations with grants reset.
- Security boundary: Server owns identity, digest, grants and revocation. Content and HTML are untrusted; resource URIs are MCP identifiers, never local paths or direct fetch targets.

## Search evidence

- GitHub searches: `modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk 1.30.0 resources prompts issues`, `modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps releases sandbox`.
- Reuse ledger: existing third-party MCP tool plugins entry and `third-party-mcp-plugins.md`.
- Inspected installed SDK 1.30.0 client source (`listResources`, `readResource`, `listPrompts`, `getPrompt`, capability checks), MIT license, prior reviewed source commit `2d889f2b329e46680ec9bdd565de4616c497825a`, upstream integration tests and session expiry issue 1708 recorded in the existing review.
- Standards: [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/resources), [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/prompts), [MCP Apps 2026-01-26](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/blob/main/specification/2026-01-26/apps.mdx).
- Apps maintained candidate: [ext-apps releases](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/releases); reviewed specification plus release v1.5.0 (`621a70a`) and later lifecycle fixes #623, #629, #631. These show that a naive postMessage renderer is not equivalent to an Apps host. Root host integration must pin its selected dependency separately before adding it.

## Candidate comparison

| Candidate | Exact version | License | Fit and decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Existing official MCP SDK | 1.30.0, `2d889f2b329e46680ec9bdd565de4616c497825a` | MIT | Released, supported Node client already installed; reuse standard discovery/read methods and existing bounded network transport. |
| MCP Apps | 2026-01-26; ext-apps v1.5.0 review | Apache-2.0 | Reuse resource MIME/metadata and isolated host lifecycle. Web host requires separate-origin sandbox proxy and restrictive CSP. Host implementation is a separate coordinated module. |
| Custom plugin fetch/eval | Local | N/A | Rejected: would duplicate MCP and expose host-origin execution. |

## Reuse decision

Add a thin bounded adapter to the existing SDK. Catalogs have up to 32 entries per capability; exact resources and prompt names are individually granted. Input/output have byte, count and schema limits. Prompt results remain untrusted user-selected material, never system instructions. Resource-only services are permitted. No subscriptions, arbitrary URI templates or unbounded pagination are silently supported.

Old tools-only digests remain compatible. New resource/prompt/app declarations are included in review digests. Update preview does not mutate installation; apply requires revision plus fresh digest and disables the plugin, clears every grant and revokes active calls. No external program is downloaded or executed by update.

Apps resources return bounded HTML only for an explicitly granted `ui://` resource with `text/html;profile=mcp-app`. Network/resource domain permissions are denied by default; declared CSP and permissions are surfaced for host enforcement, not authority. Unsupported metadata fails closed.

## Source incorporation

No upstream source copied or substantially adapted. Existing SDK remains pinned; no new dependency in this workstream. Existing third-party notices cover its MIT license.

## Verification plan

Run existing lifecycle tests plus resource/prompt discovery, required/unknown prompt arguments, cross-Bot denial, stale digest, update review races, grant reset, result bounds, unsupported payloads and real local SDK server roundtrip. Root verifies UI sandbox and Windows host independently. Bilingual plugin guide records bounds and unsupported optional protocol features without claiming full MCP conformance.

## Host dependency review (before host implementation)

Selected `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` **1.7.5**, commit `92f46a574568a3ddac7600343b7d3c4c4ed7b588`, tarball integrity `sha512-TjPH2S2y5UEGKhmI6+XGFuqfqOV4ppe1x6DA3txnUaEWkgtA4G5vo14jGKFZmegdkZ1H4QMLyujLvoU1BEdnAg==`. Inspected the published AppBridge, PostMessageTransport source, declaration files, packaged test declaration coverage and full LICENSE. The license file records Apache-2.0/MIT transition and documentation CC-BY-4.0; npm's short MIT field is incomplete. Preserve the upstream LICENSE in distribution. [Release 1.7.5](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/releases/tag/v1.7.5) includes initialization capability fixes, specification CSP fixes and reviewed advisory remediation. Its MCP SDK >=1.29 peer accepts our 1.30.0; React19 and Zod4 also fit. [Release 2.0.0](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/releases/tag/v2.0.0) requires split SDK2, while wire interoperability is unchanged and tested upstream; no need for that migration.

Use released AppBridge and PostMessageTransport without copied implementation. OpenBot's missing adapter is a bounded, source-checked connection to its Owner API and a deny-network sandbox wrapper. A trusted data-URL proxy has an opaque origin distinct from the host; it wraps an inner `allow-scripts` iframe, applies restrictive CSP before HTML content, and forwards only bounded JSON-RPC. Do not grant popups, top navigation, forms, downloads, same-origin to the view, devices, external URLs or model-context/message mutations. Close the bridge on unmount and discard stale requests. Prompts are selected before execution through real channel+Bot membership, never a fabricated Run.

## Verification results

- 2026-09-10: 21 Server tests (existing tool lifecycle plus content/update/Owner scope) and 9 UI/containment tests passed. Server and web TypeScript checks passed. The real local SDK server supplies text resources, required-argument prompts and an HTML resource; there are no external accounts or paid model calls in this evidence.
- Chrome CUA at `http://127.0.0.1:5202/`, synthetic API data: official AppBridge initialized through an opaque data-URL proxy and inner sandbox; click counter changed 0 to 1; inner `resources/read` returned the scoped notebook text. Explicit prompt preview was inserted into a draft without dispatching a task. Update controls required the reviewed checkbox before submission.
- A synthetic adversarial view showed parent DOM access blocked, localStorage blocked, fetch blocked by CSP, and unadvertised `tools/call` rejected. The host also used a parent `frame-src data:` policy. No private data was used or copied. These checks validate the tested Chromium containment boundaries, not an all-browser security certification.
- At 390×844, document width and scroll width were both 390 and the content panel was 350 pixels; controls and prompt preview remained readable without horizontal overflow. The normal desktop view also rendered correctly. Temporary viewport override was reset.
- Native browser execution caught a quoted-CSP JavaScript syntax error and missing required notification `params`; both were fixed before handoff. A trusted-proxy compile regression check now covers the syntax path. Routine development fixture HMR logs are not production failures; deliberate CSP probes produce expected console rejection messages.
- Apps expose local interaction and explicitly granted resource reads. Tool invocation, message sending, model context mutation, external network/device permissions and automatic external-service upgrades are not advertised. MCP optional templates, subscriptions and pagination remain unsupported and bounded failures are documented.

### External material must not mint attachment references

The existing attachment marker is an OpenBot transport convention, not MCP content authority. Review of the MCP 1.30.0 untrusted resource/prompt boundary and current `taskAttachmentIds` parser found that blindly inserting external text could reinterpret a reserved marker as an Owner attachment selection. The narrow adapter neutralizes every case-insensitive reserved prefix in the entire inserted label and body. Resource preview remains original text; only the draft transport representation changes. A real component test supplies a malicious prompt marker and verifies the callback cannot receive an active marker. No upstream source is copied or new dependency introduced.
