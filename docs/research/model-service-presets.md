# Research: Owner-configured model services and provider presets

[English](model-service-presets.md) · [简体中文](model-service-presets.zh-CN.md)

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-08
- Owner: @yxflc11
- Related issue: User-requested common model and popular API-provider configuration in this workspace.
- Acceptance journey: An authenticated Owner selects a provider preset, saves an API key, selects
  or enters a model, and assigns it to a new or existing model Employee. A queued Run retains its
  selected connection and model even if the Employee is subsequently changed.
- Security boundary: The Server owns connection endpoints, credentials, Employee binding, Runs,
  and audit. This remains bounded text chat; models gain no tools, memory access, or computer authority.

## Search evidence

- Search date: 2026-09-08. This is an interoperability survey, not a popularity ranking.
- GitHub queries: `openai/openai-node releases chat completions`,
  `anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript releases messages models`,
  `anomalyco/opencode custom provider baseURL models`, and `npm/write-file-atomic v8.0.0`.
- Primary API documents were checked for endpoints, model IDs, model discovery, regions,
  authentication, and reasoning/output differences:

- Volcengine Ark uses `https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3`, confirmed in the
  [official runtime constants](https://github.com/volcengine/volcengine-python-sdk/blob/5.0.48/volcenginesdkarkruntime/_constants.py)
  and release `5.0.48` (2026-09-03). Its preset requires an explicitly entered account
  inference-endpoint/model ID; no compatible model-discovery or fixed model default is claimed.
- The Model Studio documentation says existing DashScope domains remain usable during migration
  to workspace-specific MaaS domains. Coding/Token Plan endpoints are separate products and are
  not silently substituted for these standard API routes.
- Existing reuse entries checked: Server model chat (`kimi-model-chat.md`), PostgreSQL stores,
  Owner profile revision checks, atomic sensitive files, and POSIX credential permission drift.
- Reviewed SDK issues: OpenAI [#1825](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/issues/1825) and
  [#2153](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/issues/2153) timeout behavior; Anthropic
  [#1170](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript/issues/1170) streaming-body retries
  and [#1162](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript/issues/1162) schema helpers.
  The chosen slice uses JSON text requests, no streaming upload, no schema helper, no retries,
  and an explicit total deadline and response-byte limit.

## Reuse decision

- Selected option: documented compatibility APIs and released SDKs behind thin text adapters.
  Compatibility APIs are not described as an independent open standard.
- Why first viable: the existing SDK already supports most reviewed providers; a second native
  SDK handles Anthropic without implementing a competing wire client or adding an agent framework.
- Exact local gap: provider presets, bounded model discovery with manual entry, Owner create/update/disable operations,
  encrypted connection credentials, Employee binding, immutable Run selection, and content-free audit.
- Connection protocol, provider, and endpoint are immutable after creation. Key rotation and
  enable/disable are revision checked. Changing an endpoint requires a new connection, preventing
  queued Runs from silently changing destination. Missing/disabled connections never fall back.
- Presets permit only exact reviewed URLs. Custom compatible endpoints require an explicit exact
  Server operator allowlist; arbitrary browser input cannot direct Server credentials to a new host.
  No URL userinfo/query/fragment, HTTP endpoint, or redirect is accepted.
- API keys are authenticated-encrypted in PostgreSQL with AAD binding the connection ID/provider/
  endpoint. The separate local key is never exported; loss of that key fails closed. Connection
  changes and content-free audit are committed in one database transaction. The automatically
  initialized POSIX `0600` key file defaults to `./data/model-credentials.key` through
  `OPENBOT_MODEL_CREDENTIAL_KEY_PATH`; operators must back it up with PostgreSQL. If any saved
  connection exists, missing-key startup refuses to generate a replacement.
- Legacy `MOONSHOT_*` remains a Server-only fallback for pre-existing unbound model Employees;
  environment keys are not copied into the connection store. Employee packages do not export
  local bindings or credentials.
- Model IDs remain open to manual entry, including `/`, `:` and provider prefixes. Model discovery
  is a bounded list operation, not a claim that every listed model supports text chat or that a
  key has paid inference access. Discovery reads one SDK page, caps the response at 2 MiB, and
  returns at most 256 IDs. OpenRouter uses `GET /models?output_modalities=text`; SiliconFlow uses
  `GET /models?type=text&sub_type=chat`. A separate explicit test call checks text inference and
  may incur charges; saving a connection never runs that test.
- Parameter adapters omit unsupported sampling/reasoning knobs. OpenAI and Kimi K3 use
  `max_completion_tokens`; K3 uses `reasoning_effort: low` by default, while the legacy environment
  adapter retains its configured effort. Other compatible adapters use the reviewed `max_tokens`
  field; MiniMax requests `reasoning_split: true` and rejects mixed `<think>` output. Anthropic
  uses native Messages, top-level `system`, required `max_tokens`, and visible text blocks only.
  Its explicit `authToken: null` prevents ambient bearer credentials from following a saved Key.
  Chat response bytes remain capped at 256 KiB; redirects, automatic retries, tool output,
  nontext output, and incomplete replies are rejected. Private reasoning is never rendered or persisted.
- Exit plan: update pinned SDKs and data-only provider entries after review; retain ModelClient,
  Server authority, and portable Employee contracts. Native keyring/KMS can replace the key adapter.

## Source incorporation

- Source copied or substantially adapted: no.
- Files and upstream locations: installed SDK dependencies only; local policy/configuration code
  calls their public APIs and Node crypto. No upstream agent runtime is embedded.
- Notices: dependency packages retain their Apache-2.0/MIT/ISC notices; the reuse ledger links this review.

## Verification plan

- Automated: provider request shapes, bounded discovery, HTTP auth/Origin gates, credential
  redaction/encryption, Owner revisions, per-Employee selection, immutable queued Run binding,
  existing Kimi compatibility, and full `npm run check`.
- Negative: unknown preset/endpoint, disabled or missing connection, stale revision, lost or
  tampered key/ciphertext, exposed/symlink key file, oversized responses, tool/nontext/truncated
  output, upstream errors, cancellation and deadline. Never echo provider response bodies/keys.
- Database: disposable PostgreSQL migration/store checks for encrypted persistence, audit and
  binding snapshots. UI: preset -> connection -> model selection -> Employee binding at desktop
  and mobile widths, including unavailable discovery and manual IDs.
- Documentation: English and Chinese setup/API/reuse documentation.
- Support level: experimental Server text adapters with contract tests on the observed local
  environment. Live inference is only claimed for providers actually exercised with authorized keys.

## Unresolved questions

- Native tool calling, token streaming, automatic model routing, automatic paid fallback/retries,
  favorites/recent lists, price synchronization, native keyrings, and KMS remain separate work.
