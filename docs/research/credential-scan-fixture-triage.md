# Research: Exact historical credential-scan fixture triage

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-08
- Owner: @yxflc11
- Related issue: CI run `34207930929`, security job on main `979c989`.
- Acceptance journey: Complete Git history remains scanned; one reviewed synthetic URL fixture
  does not block unrelated builds, while every other finding or scanner failure blocks CI.
- Security boundary: No credential verification, result upload, history rewrite, detector exclusion,
  or whole-file exclusion. Candidate values stay in temporary runner files and never enter logs.

## Search evidence

- GitHub queries: `trufflesecurity/trufflehog exclude findings false positive git history allowlist`.
- Reviewed [TruffleHog source](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/tree/20652fbbdefffcdaa493a5bf57ab2ac6b1db715b),
  especially `main.go`, `pkg/sources/git/git.go`, URI detector and Git parser tests;
  [upstream ignore guidance](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/20652fbbdefffcdaa493a5bf57ab2ac6b1db715b/PreCommit.md),
  and [path exclusion issue #420](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/issues/420).
- Existing review: [DEV-001 hardening](dev-001-short-term-hardening.md), CI dependency and secret
  scanning entry in [reuse ledger](../OPEN_SOURCE_REUSE.md).
- Reproduction: the exact pinned image returned 0 for main-only history and 183 after fetching all
  remote branches as CI does. There was one URI finding in `apps/server/src/model-web-tools.test.ts`,
  line 188, commit `9cc73c9e78451e572f57d142d6b9caf62ccb78e2`. The source deliberately rejects
  a URL with synthetic username/password on reserved `example.com`; it is not an account credential.
  Both candidate fields have SHA-256 `1231625e7e70c4e56347672932d37a1c35eff89051483b37cbd09f7b9c58337e`.

## Candidate comparison

| Candidate | Exact release or commit | License | Maintenance and tests | Platform/API/security fit | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Existing TruffleHog plus JSON adapter | `3.97.1`, `20652fbbdefffcdaa493a5bf57ab2ac6b1db715b`; existing image digest retained | AGPL-3.0 external tool | Existing reviewed release, source and detector/parser tests; local real scan reproduced | JSON exposes commit/path/line, detector, verification and exact candidate; exit 1 takes precedence over findings exit 183 | Select thin adapter |
| Native path/detector exclusion | Same pin | AGPL-3.0 | Documented CLI flags and source | Would exempt other values in the file or detector | Reject broad exclusion |
| Inline ignore or editing current fixture | Same pin | AGPL-3.0 | Upstream documents inline ignores | Cannot annotate an immutable historical line without rewriting published history | Insufficient for this historical finding |
| Gitleaks replacement | `v8.27.2`, `c7acf33`, already reviewed in DEV-001 | MIT | Maintained static alternative | Would change the existing detector coverage to solve one known false positive | Retain as reserve |

## Reuse decision

- Selected: reuse the pinned TruffleHog JSON output and exit contract through a small Node adapter.
- Exact local gap: accept only the reviewed combination of immutable commit, path, line, URI
  detector ID/name, unverified state, and SHA-256 of both raw candidate fields. Do not exempt any
  other commit, path, detector, candidate, or verified finding.
- Keep scanning all fetched history. Require exit 0 with no findings or 183 with findings; reject
  scanner errors, invalid JSON, malformed findings, oversized output and inconsistent exit/results.
- No dependency, scanner source copy, or substantial adaptation. The external scanner is neither
  linked nor shipped; its existing license treatment is unchanged.
- Replace the adapter with an upstream exact historical finding mechanism if one becomes viable.

## Verification plan

- Negative tests for changed commit/path/line/detector/value, verified findings, mixed findings,
  malformed/oversized output, scanner errors and inconsistent exit codes; never print candidates.
- Workflow regression tests retain full-history, read-only, digest-pinned scanning and require the
  JSON adapter without failure bypasses. Run `npm run check` and replay actual full-history output.
- GitHub-hosted CI provides the final Linux runner evidence; local Docker on macOS only proves
  the pinned scanner and adapter behavior on that environment.

## Desktop UI PR historical fixtures (2026-09-09)

PR #23, CI run `34344341115`, security job `102442260610` passed the production dependency audit
with zero vulnerabilities, then failed the exact-finding adapter. Replayed the same digest-pinned
TruffleHog image with verification disabled, no update, read-only temporary Git checkout and
`--network none`. The completed scan returned 183 with three URI findings: the previously reviewed
fixture and two additional synthetic negative-test URLs. Candidate values were not printed.

Reviewed the exact pinned [URI detector source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/20652fbbdefffcdaa493a5bf57ab2ac6b1db715b/pkg/detectors/uri/uri.go)
and the existing candidate comparison above. Search terms: `trufflesecurity/trufflehog false
positive git history URI credentials allowlist`. Retain the same released detector and thin JSON
adapter: modifying only today's tests cannot remove immutable published history, while path or
URI-detector exclusions would conceal unrelated findings. No dependency update or scanner bypass
is needed.

Both findings use detector 17 / URI, `Verified: false`; unlike the original fixture, their RawV2
fields include a path, so each raw field needs its own exact digest. Extend the immutable tuple
list only by these two reviewed entries. Rewrite current negative fixtures using URL username and
password setters so later test edits do not introduce fresh literal credential-pattern findings.
The exercised rejection behavior remains identical. Test mutations of every tuple field, mixed
unreviewed findings and scanner errors, then replay the actual complete result file. No scanner
source is copied or substantially adapted; all existing security gates remain enabled.

Validation completed: 13 credential/workflow contract tests, 20 Desktop support-link tests and
31 native-web-tools tests passed. The complete offline scanner was replayed against a disposable
Git clone containing the candidate fix as a temporary commit; it returned only the same three
historical findings, and the adapter passed with `3 exact historical fixture(s)`. The disposable
commit was never pushed. Hosted CI on the final combined commit remains the release gate.

## Plugin admission fixture (2026-09-10)

PR #29 failed because full history adds one URI match from commit `cb057607a100ccc10dd4cec6eece6c9cfc4a5158`, `apps/server/src/plugin-service.test.ts:385`. The exact pinned scanner replayed offline over a disposable clone reports four matches total, zero verified secrets. Source inspection confirms the extra literal is a synthetic `example.com` userinfo URL in a negative `normalizePluginEndpoint` test, with no request sent. Raw SHA-256: `1231625e7e70c4e56347672932d37a1c35eff89051483b37cbd09f7b9c58337e`; RawV2: `64af6524d4fcec9a8688550461aea8ddd09ec210db19f00be93ddc558b2b5ebb`. Extend the same immutable commit/path/line/detector/hash tuple, with mutation tests, and construct the current fixture through URL setters to avoid new historical matches. No detector/path exclusion, verification, upload or scanner change.
