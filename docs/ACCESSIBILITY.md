# Accessibility baseline

[English](ACCESSIBILITY.md) · [简体中文](ACCESSIBILITY.zh-CN.md)

OpenBot is not claiming WCAG conformance yet. This document records the interaction patterns that
are implemented, the upstream work they follow, the checks that were run, and the gaps contributors
must not accidentally describe as complete.

## Upstream review

The 2026-09-04 employee-flow audit reviewed these maintained sources before changing local code:

| Source | Pinned baseline | License | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/tree/7e4034b262bc0d25332e330d8a582aaf34113829) | `7e4034b2` | W3C Software and Document License | Adopt the normative roles, state relationships, roving focus, and keyboard behavior for tabs and modal dialogs. No example source was copied. |
| [Adobe React Spectrum](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/50279a10ab998572e240e44aa36f84a15c7c4f99) | `50279a10` | Apache-2.0 | Use as a mature React implementation reference. Do not add its component and styling stack for the current fixed profile tabs and native dialogs. No source was copied. |
| [HTML `dialog` WCAG technique H102](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H102) | updated 2026-01-12 | W3C document license | Use the browser's `showModal()` implementation for focus containment, background inertness, Escape handling, and focus restoration instead of recreating a focus trap. |

The local code is deliberately small: OpenBot-specific tab state remains in the employee profile,
and a thin React hook connects the native dialog lifecycle to application state. If future flows
need nested overlays, async collections, orientation changes, or virtualized tabs, reassess React
Aria Components before extending the local implementation.

## Implemented baseline

- Employee profile navigation exposes one `tablist`, seven `tab` elements, one labelled
  `tabpanel`, and a single tab stop for the selected tab.
- Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Home, and End move focus and activate the expected profile view with
  wrapping at both ends.
- Create Bot, Create Channel, employee export, and employee import use native modal dialogs.
- Opening a modal moves focus inside it; Tab remains inside the modal; Escape closes it; closing
  returns focus to the control that opened it.
- Existing validation errors use `role="alert"`, background content becomes inert while a dialog is
  open, and icon-only close controls have accessible names.
- The employee profile and export review were manually checked in the Codex in-app browser at a
  desktop three-column layout and at `390 × 844` CSS pixels. The phone profile had no document-level
  horizontal overflow, and the export dialog remained inside the viewport.

## Reproduce the checks

Run the deterministic repository checks:

```bash
npm --workspace @openbot/web test
npm --workspace @openbot/web run typecheck
npm run lint
```

Then verify the browser behavior:

1. Open a Bot's employee profile.
2. Focus `概览`; use Right Arrow, Left Arrow, Home, and End; confirm focus, selection, and visible
   panel change together.
3. Open `导出模板`; confirm focus begins inside the dialog and background controls cannot receive
   focus.
4. Press Escape; confirm the dialog closes and focus returns to `导出模板`.
5. Repeat the profile and export flow at a 390-pixel phone viewport and confirm there is no
   document-level horizontal scroll.

## Known gaps

- VoiceOver/Safari, NVDA/Firefox or Chrome, and Orca/Firefox manual screen-reader matrices have not
  been run on real operating systems.
- Automated accessibility regression tooling has not been selected or integrated.
- Contrast, forced-colors, reduced-motion, text zoom, and 200%/400% reflow need explicit evidence.
- The Run Inspector and mobile navigation sheets still use custom overlay behavior and need the same
  upstream-first focus-management review.
- The interface text is currently Chinese-first; locale selection, translated accessible names,
  directionality, and pseudolocale testing remain planned.

An accessibility contribution must include the tested browser/assistive-technology combination,
before/after behavior, and a regression test where the repository toolchain can express it.
