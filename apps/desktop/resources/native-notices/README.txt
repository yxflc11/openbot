OpenBot native PostgreSQL preview notices

The locked @embedded-postgres/darwin-arm64 and darwin-x64 packages are
17.10.0-beta.17, git c23ad8a026c711c8666c3c2596d0fde643cf378a.
Their MIT packager license is copied separately into postgres/PACKAGER-LICENSE.md.
PostgreSQL is 17.10, distributed under the PostgreSQL License.

License texts in this directory are unmodified upstream notices (Libedit.txt is
its source-file license header only). sources.json records exact source URLs and
SHA-256 hashes. No executable library source has been copied into OpenBot.
The source-linked notices do not constitute a reproducible binary provenance
attestation. The extracted binary inventory confirms PostgreSQL 17.10, OpenSSL
3.0.20, ICU 68.2, LZ4 1.10.0, Zstandard 1.5.7 and zlib 1.3.2. Libxml2, Kerberos,
libedit, libiconv, gettext and libuuid notices are retained from the pinned source
revisions listed in sources.json; exact correspondence to the repacked binaries
still needs distributor confirmation before public redistribution.

The native binary lineage repacks EnterpriseDB's PostgreSQL distribution:
https://get.enterprisedb.com/postgresql/postgresql-17.10-1-osx-binaries.zip
The upstream repack script excludes most documentation. Its archive includes
PostgreSQL's legal notice but not a complete per-library provenance manifest.

Do not publish this development bundle as a licensed, attested release until the
complete native dependency/source inventory and LGPL source/relinking obligations
are verified. libiconv and gettext are dynamically linked LGPL libraries; their
license texts and source references must travel with any reviewed distribution.
OpenBot's MIT license does not replace these licenses or prohibit modification,
replacement or reverse engineering permitted by them. No library is statically
incorporated into OpenBot application code.

Windows source-built runtime (2026-09-10)

The Windows runtime is built from the official PostgreSQL 17.11 source archive
by scripts/build-windows-postgresql.ps1, not @embedded-postgres/windows-x64.
The previous Windows npm candidate was rejected because its modified LGPL DLL
source/provenance was incomplete. It is not a permitted packaging fallback.
Windows-specific build provenance and complete notices travel inside
postgres/openbot-postgresql-build.json and postgres/licenses. The Darwin
source/version inventory above must not be used as Windows provenance.
See docs/research/windows-desktop-completion.md for the build and CI boundary.
