# Windows PostgreSQL source-build notices

OpenBot's Windows Desktop runtime builds **unmodified PostgreSQL 17.11 source** with the official Meson/MSVC build system. The source archive is verified against both the pinned SHA-256 and PostgreSQL's published checksum before extraction. The binary is not taken from the npm/EDB repack.

The source-build script is `scripts/build-windows-postgresql.ps1`. Run it in a licensed Windows x64 MSVC environment with Python 3, Perl and PowerShell 7. It downloads hash-pinned Meson, Ninja and WinFlexBison into a disposable build directory; these tools are not installed into or shipped with the application. The script uses PostgreSQL's public build options and changes no upstream source. It runs PostgreSQL's setup and main regression suite before generating a manifest. The separate Desktop CI harness checks application migrations, UTF-8, SCRAM authentication and restart/persistence.

The runtime includes PostgreSQL's own SQL, JSON, PL/pgSQL, built-in SCRAM and UTF-8 support. NLS/gettext/iconv, ICU collation, OpenSSL/TLS, XML/XSLT, readline, external procedural languages, compression libraries and JIT are disabled. This database is used on loopback and does not claim remote TLS service or arbitrary third-party binary-extension compatibility. The Microsoft C runtime is statically linked by MSVC (`b_vscrt=mt`), under the licensed Microsoft toolchain's distributable-code terms. Windows system APIs are provided by Windows. No EDB, GNU runtime, or separately downloaded Microsoft runtime DLL is copied into this database package.

## What recipients receive

Every built runtime contains a `licenses` directory with this notice, the exact official PostgreSQL source archive and checksum, build script, build options, upstream regression log, and embedded-source copyright notices. `openbot-postgresql-build.json` records source/tool versions, compiler hash, runner image, actual build time, all binary imports and the SHA-256/size of every installed file. The installer includes these materials; CI also retains a separate source/provenance artifact. Toolchain versions are recorded for reproduction, but the build is not claimed to be bit-for-bit deterministic.

- `PostgreSQL-COPYRIGHT`: exact upstream PostgreSQL license.
- `Regex-COPYRIGHT`: Henry Spencer's regex notices shipped in the source.
- `Embedded-source-notices.txt`: verbatim license/copyright comments from the source; `embedded-notice-sources.json` maps each block to its original file and hash. Includes optional/build-only source conservatively.
- `Snowball-COPYING`: exact BSD notice from commit `48a67a2831005f49c48ec29a5837640e23e54e6b`, the version explicitly identified by PostgreSQL's Snowball README.
- `IANA-timezone.txt`: public-domain data statement and upstream source context.
- `Bison-GPL-3.0.txt`, `Bison-output-exception.txt`, and `Flex-COPYING`: parser-generator output notices. The actual generated parser's notice is also extracted into the installed artifact. Bison's output exception allows the larger PostgreSQL work to retain its own license; generator tools are not redistributed with OpenBot.
- `sources.json`: reviewed source URLs, hashes and notice inventory.

Users may inspect or replace this separately installed PostgreSQL runtime with a compatible build; application startup still enforces its executable/path/security policy. OpenBot does not restrict reverse engineering of these open-source components or inspection/debugging of changes to them. There is no LGPL corresponding-source offer for the selected runtime because the unresolved LGPL DLLs are not used or distributed.

`rejected-edb/` is repository audit evidence for a rejected candidate. Those files are expressly excluded by the source-build packaging script. Their presence does not authorize redistributing the old binary repack or imply that its corresponding-source gap was resolved.

Read [the research decision](../../docs/research/windows-postgresql-redistribution.md) for the exact candidate comparison and validation status. A successful source-build manifest proves the upstream suite completed for that artifact; it does not replace the Desktop Windows installation test.
